# Renewable Electricity Production Visualization App

This project visualizes the production of electricity of renewable origin competing in the auctions for Origin Guarantees (GO) at the level of electricity distribution and transmission networks in France. It provides comprehensive insights into the dynamics of renewable energy production, focusing on energy types such as Onshore Wind, Hydropower, Solar, and Geothermal. The visualizations are created with Python using Streamlit and Plotly for interactive and expressive charts.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this application is sourced from [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/productions-delectricite-dorigine-renouvelable-aux-encheres-des-garanties-dorigine/).

### Overview

The dataset presents, by region and sector, the productions of renewable origin electricity that compete in the auctions for Origin Guarantees (GO) at the level of electricity distribution and transmission networks.

### Details

- **Target:** Renewable electricity production installations with installed capacity greater than 100 kW.
- **Scope:** Installations benefiting from a support mechanism of either obligatory purchase or supplemental remuneration.
- **Time Frame:** Since March 2019.
- **Update Frequency:** Monthly.
- **Data Providers:** The ORE Agency and the DSOs.

#### Data Process

Since March 2019, the DSOs mandate the ORE Agency to make available to the entity responsible for conducting the auctions, a database of the concerned installations. This database is updated monthly by the co-contractors and supplemented by the DSOs within 2 months following a month of production of the value of the net monthly production injected into the network.

## App Features
