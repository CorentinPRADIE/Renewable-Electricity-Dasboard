# Renewable Electricity Production App

Immerse yourself in an interactive exploration of renewable electricity production in France through this app. Dive into the visual explorations [here](https://pradie-corentin-renewable-electricity-app.streamlit.app/).

## Introduction

The Renewable Electricity Production App invites users to explore, analyze, and visualize comprehensive data related to renewable electricity production across various regions in France. The data highlights the evolution and contributions of different renewable energy types, providing users a detailed overview of France's renewable energy landscape.

### Data Source and Insights

The data is sourced from [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/productions-delectricite-dorigine-renouvelable-aux-encheres-des-garanties-dorigine/), detailing renewable electricity production from installations with a capacity exceeding 100 kW. These installations, benefitting from support mechanisms such as obligatory purchase or supplemental remuneration, are pivotal contributors to the renewable energy matrix in France.

Detailed monthly production values, updated by co-contractors and supplemented by Distribution System Operators (DSOs) within two months following a production month, furnish the dataset.
